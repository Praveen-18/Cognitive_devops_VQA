## Description
Virtual Q&A in Healthcare is a web-based platform that allows users to upload medical images, ask questions, and receive accurate answers using machine learning and computer vision techniques. The system leverages advanced algorithms and deep learning models trained on a large dataset of medical images and question-answer pairs.

## Note on Model Files

Please note that the model files (pickle and joblib) are not included in this repository due to their large size. Uploading large binary files like these can be impractical for version control systems and may cause issues with repository size and download times. 

If you need access to the model files, please contact us directly, and we'll be happy to provide you with the necessary files separately.


## About

Welcome to Virtual Q&A in Healthcare! Our platform utilizes advanced machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision techniques to provide accurate answers to medical queries based on uploaded images. With a user-friendly interface powered by Django framework, users can easily upload medical images, ask questions, and receive precise responses generated by our intelligent algorithms.

Our system incorporates machine learning models like Support Vector Machines and Random Forest, as well as deep learning models like ResNet50, to analyze and extract relevant information from the uploaded medical images. We leverage computer vision techniques, such as the Haar Cascade Frontal Face algorithm, to enhance the accuracy of our image analysis.

In addition to the question-answering functionality, our platform offers features like virtual consultation with healthcare professionals, health tips for preventative care, and a blog section to provide valuable medical information and updates.

Our goal is to enhance healthcare services by leveraging cutting-edge technologies, providing accurate medical insights, and enabling users to make informed decisions about their health.

Explore our platform and experience the power of intelligent healthcare assistance!
